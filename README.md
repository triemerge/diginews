### Gates Foundation and OpenAI Launch $50M Initiative to Integrate AI into African Healthcare Systems

The Gates Foundation and OpenAI have announced a new $50 million collaboration to integrate artificial intelligence into national health systems across Africa, beginning with a pilot program in Rwanda. This initiative, named Horizon1000, aims to utilize AI tools to bolster primary healthcare delivery, support healthcare workers, enhance the quality of care, and broaden patient reach in resource-constrained areas.

Sub-Saharan Africa currently faces a critical shortage of approximately 5.6 million health workers, a gap that traditional training alone is unlikely to bridge. Horizon1000 will explore how AI can augment clinical capacity, streamline workflows, and empower frontline health workers to serve more patients efficiently. The program is slated to expand to 1,000 primary healthcare clinics and surrounding communities across multiple African countries by 2028, with a strong emphasis on responsible deployment and ethical application of AI, guided by national governments.

**Key Takeaway:** A significant $50 million partnership between the Gates Foundation and OpenAI is leveraging AI to address critical healthcare workforce shortages and improve primary care delivery across Africa, starting in Rwanda.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
