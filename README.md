### Fitbit Users Must Migrate Data to Google Accounts by May

Fitbit users are being urged to migrate their data to a Google account by May to avoid losing access to crucial historic health metrics. The deadline applies to data points such as heart rate, workouts, calorie burn, and sleep time, which could be permanently lost if users miss the transition. This move continues Google's integration of Fitbit following its acquisition.

**Key Takeaway:** Fitbit users face a May deadline to migrate their health data to a Google account or risk permanent loss of their historical fitness information.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
