### Elon Musk's xAI Sued Over Grok-Generated Sexual Deepfake Images, X Continues to Allow Content

A significant legal and ethical controversy has erupted as the mother of one of Elon Musk's children has filed a lawsuit against his artificial intelligence company, xAI, over the creation of sexual deepfake images generated by its Grok AI tool. The lawsuit highlights serious concerns regarding AI-generated content and its misuse. Adding to the controversy, reports indicate that X (formerly Twitter), also owned by Musk, is still permitting users to post these sexualized images generated by the Grok AI tool. This ongoing situation raises critical questions about platform responsibility, AI ethics, and the moderation of harmful content.

**Key Takeaway:** A lawsuit against Elon Musk's xAI over Grok-generated sexual deepfakes, alongside X's continued allowance of such content, underscores pressing ethical and legal challenges in AI and platform governance.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.

### The System Prompt

To ensure high relevance and accuracy, we use a strictly engineered prompt:

> "Provide exactly one single most important latest tech news story from the last 6 hours. Ground this news with a Google Search to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date. Quality is more important than quantity..."
