### Tesla Shifts Autopilot Features to $99-Per-Month Full Self-Driving Subscription

Tesla has implemented a significant change to its vehicle features, requiring owners to pay for a new $99-per-month Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscription to retain access to previously included functionalities like Autosteer. This move mandates that Tesla owners wishing to keep these advanced driver-assistance features will need to subscribe to FSD or purchase the complete FSD package for $8,000 before February 14. This strategic decision by Tesla impacts existing owners who relied on these features without an ongoing subscription and marks a notable shift in the company's monetization strategy for its autonomous driving technology.

**Key Takeaway:** Tesla is now requiring a $99 monthly subscription or an $8,000 upfront purchase for features like Autosteer, fundamentally changing access to core driver-assistance technologies for its customers.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
