### Nasdaq Index Forecast Turns Bearish Amid AI-Driven Tech Stress

The Nasdaq Index is showing a bearish forecast after breaking below its 50-day moving average, signaling growing stress within the technology sector, particularly concerning AI-driven companies. Published at 09:56 GMT+00:00 on February 4, 2026, this analysis highlights intensifying fears related to AI, as major software firms like ServiceNow, Salesforce, and Intuit have experienced significant year-to-date declines. The breach of the 50-day moving average increases the risk of the Nasdaq Index accelerating towards its key December and November lows. Investor anxiety is further indicated by the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) jumping above 20 intraday, as markets await crucial earnings reports from tech giants Amazon and Alphabet. Analysts are questioning whether the current market activity represents a healthy broadening or the beginning of a genuine correction in the tech sector, with conditions potentially shifting rapidly following the upcoming earnings releases.

**Key Takeaway:** The Nasdaq Index is facing a bearish outlook driven by increasing investor concerns over AI's impact and recent declines in major tech stocks, raising questions about a potential broader tech market correction.
