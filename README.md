### Honda and Mythic Partner to Develop 100x Energy-Efficient Analog AI Chip for Next-Generation Vehicles

Honda Motor Co., Ltd. and Mythic have announced a joint development agreement to create a highly energy-efficient analog AI System-on-Chip (SOC) for future software-defined vehicles (SDVs). The collaboration involves Honda R&D Co. Ltd. licensing Mythic's Analog Processing Unit (APU) technology. This partnership aims to integrate Mythic's intelligent, ultra-efficient analog compute-in-memory technology into Honda's vehicles by the late 2020s or early 2030s, aligning with Honda's focus on safety. The goal is to produce an AI chip that is 100 times more energy-efficient than current solutions, which could revolutionize the capabilities and sustainability of AI in automotive applications.

**Key Takeaway:** Honda's collaboration with Mythic to develop a 100x more energy-efficient analog AI chip signals a significant leap in bringing advanced, sustainable AI capabilities to future vehicles.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
