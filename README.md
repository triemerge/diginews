### Amazon's Project Kuiper Faces Deployment Delays, Seeks Extension from FCC
Amazon's Project Kuiper, its ambitious satellite internet constellation designed to rival SpaceX's Starlink, has informed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that it requires more time to deploy its satellites. The company will not meet the July deadline to launch half of its low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation. Amazon has outlined plans for "more than 100 missions planned through Q1 2029" to deploy the constellation. This development indicates a potential setback in the race to provide global satellite internet access, as Amazon works to catch up to competitors who already have thousands of satellites in orbit.

**Key Takeaway:** Amazon's Project Kuiper is experiencing delays in its satellite deployment schedule, necessitating an extension from the FCC and potentially impacting its competitive standing in the satellite internet market.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
