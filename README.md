### SpaceX Acquires xAI in Trillion-Dollar Merger to Pursue Orbital AI Data Centers

Elon Musk's space exploration company, SpaceX, has officially acquired his artificial intelligence venture, xAI, in a colossal merger reportedly valued at $1.25 trillion. The strategic consolidation aims to integrate both companies' ambitious goals, particularly focusing on the development of "orbital data centers" for artificial intelligence. This visionary concept proposes leveraging the unique advantages of space, such as abundant solar power and the vacuum for enhanced cooling, to create highly efficient AI computing infrastructure.

The merger combines SpaceX's prowess in rocket technology and satellite internet (Starlink) with xAI's artificial intelligence capabilities. This move could significantly reshape the future of AI infrastructure by moving critical computing resources off-world, potentially offering unparalleled performance and scalability for advanced AI models. While experts note that the logistical challenges of deploying such extensive hardware into space would be considerable, the combined entity underscores a bold commitment to push the boundaries of both space technology and artificial intelligence.

**Key Takeaway:** Elon Musk's merger of SpaceX and xAI signals a highly ambitious strategy to revolutionize AI infrastructure by developing space-based data centers, potentially altering the landscape of high-performance computing.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
