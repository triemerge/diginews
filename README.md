### Fitbit Users Face May Deadline to Migrate Data to Google Accounts
Fitbit users are being urged to migrate their health and fitness data to Google accounts by May 2026, or risk permanently losing access to their historical information. This migration impacts key personal metrics such as heart rate, workout logs, calorie burn, and sleep patterns, which are central to the Fitbit experience. The deadline comes as Google continues to integrate Fitbit services following its acquisition of the company. Users who fail to complete the data transfer by the specified date could lose valuable insights accumulated over years of using their Fitbit devices.

**Key Takeaway:** Fitbit users must migrate their data to a Google account by May 2026 to avoid losing access to their health and fitness history.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
