### SpaceX Acquires xAI in Trillion-Dollar Merger
SpaceX has announced its acquisition of xAI, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, in a deal valued at over $1 trillion. This merger aims to create a vertically integrated entity combining AI, rockets, space-based internet, and direct-to-mobile communications. The strategic move is designed to unify Musk's aerospace and AI ventures, centered around the Grok chatbot and the X social platform, significantly expanding his tech empire as SpaceX reportedly eyes a public listing later this year.

SpaceX was valued at approximately $800 billion in a December investor note, while xAI's valuation stood at about $230 billion following a $20 billion Series E funding round. The companies emphasize that space-based data centers will be crucial for scaling AI at a massive level, arguing that terrestrial solutions alone will be insufficient to meet future demand. This announcement follows earlier cross-holdings among Musk's various ventures and previous market speculation about a potential deal.

**Key Takeaway:** Elon Musk is consolidating his formidable tech interests by merging SpaceX and xAI, aiming to create an unprecedented ecosystem that integrates advanced AI with space technology and global communication networks.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
