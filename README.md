### Microsoft Unveils $50 Billion AI Initiative for Global South, Bolstering India's AI Ambitions

Microsoft has announced a significant $50 billion commitment towards advancing artificial intelligence across the Global South, with a particular focus on India. This expansive initiative, unveiled during the India AI Impact Summit 2026, aims to bridge the growing AI divide and foster inclusive economic development through technology.

The comprehensive plan includes a major educator program in India, targeting the training of 5.6 million people in 2025 and an ambitious goal to equip 20 million Indians with AI credentials by 2030 through programs like "Microsoft Elevate for Educators," which will support two million teachers across over 200,000 schools. Beyond skilling, Microsoft intends to equip 25,000 institutions with inclusive AI infrastructure and integrate AI learning pathways into prominent government platforms. The company's investment in the Global South last fiscal year already exceeded $2 billion, supporting schools and non-profits with financial grants, technology donations, and discounted products. This move is positioned as a critical intervention to prevent the widening AI usage gap between the Global North and South from exacerbating existing economic disparities, as highlighted by Microsoft's AI Diffusion Report. Furthermore, Microsoft is contributing adoption metrics through GitHub repositories and Azure Foundry to support the World Bank's forthcoming Global AI Adoption Index, recognizing India's significant developer ecosystem with 24 million developers.

**Key Takeaway:** Microsoft's substantial $50 billion investment in AI development across the Global South, with a strong emphasis on education and infrastructure in India, marks a pivotal effort to democratize AI access and mitigate global technological disparities.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
