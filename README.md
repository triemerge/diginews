### Global Tech Giants Form "Trusted Tech Alliance" to Establish Shared Principles

At the Munich Security Conference on Friday, February 13, 2026, fifteen prominent technology companies from Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America announced the formation of the "Trusted Tech Alliance (TTA)." This new consortium aims to establish and uphold a shared set of principles for a reliable and secure technology stack, encompassing areas such as connectivity, cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, software, and artificial intelligence. The initiative responds to the rapid pace of technological change and increasing complexity in the digital landscape, where customers and countries are seeking greater resilience and reliability from technology providers.

The TTA members are committing to common standards of transparency, security, and data protection, with the goal of fostering trust and ensuring the benefits of technology reach people globally. Signatories to the Alliance include major industry players like Anthropic, AWS, Cassava Technologies, Cohere, Ericsson, Google Cloud, Hanwha, Jio Platforms, Microsoft, Nokia, Nscale, NTT, Rapidus, Saab, and SAP. The alliance emphasizes working with governments and customers to guarantee that emerging technologies contribute to public trust, job creation, and economic growth.

**Key Takeaway:** A coalition of global tech leaders has formed the Trusted Tech Alliance to establish common principles for security, transparency, and data protection across the technology stack, aiming to build trust in a rapidly evolving digital world.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
