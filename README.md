### India AI Impact Summit Underlines Nation's AI Leadership with 100 Million ChatGPT Users

India is currently hosting its inaugural AI Impact Summit, a significant event highlighting the nation's burgeoning role in the global artificial intelligence landscape. Amidst discussions on the future and impact of AI, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT has reached an impressive milestone of 100 million weekly active users in India, demonstrating the rapid and widespread adoption of AI technologies within the country. Prime Minister Modi has affirmed India's position at the forefront of AI transformation. Further emphasizing India's digital prowess, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) launched the 'UPI One World' wallet service at the summit, specifically catering to foreign delegates. Industry experts like Microsoft India President Puneet Chandok have also contributed to the discourse, projecting that AI will primarily reshape jobs rather than eliminate them. However, there are also calls for careful consideration, with CEA Nageswaran emphasizing that technological transformation must align with mass employability.

**Key Takeaway:** The ongoing India AI Impact Summit solidifies the nation's growing influence in the global AI arena, with Sam Altman's revelation of 100 million weekly ChatGPT users in India underscoring the country's rapid embrace of artificial intelligence.
