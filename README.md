### Former Google CEO Warns of Impending US Electricity Shortage Due to AI Growth

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has issued a stark warning that the United States is rapidly approaching an electricity shortage, primarily driven by the escalating energy demands of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Schmidt emphasized that an additional 92 gigawatts of power will be required to sustain the rapid expansion of AI, pointing to the immense strain placed on the nation's energy infrastructure by vast data centers and their intensive cooling requirements. These remarks echo similar concerns from other tech leaders, with some predicting a doubling of electricity rates within five years if structural reforms are not implemented. The rapid build-out of AI infrastructure, which is highly energy-intensive, is creating a critical bottleneck that could significantly impact the future growth and deployment of AI across various sectors.

**Key Takeaway:** The exponential growth of AI is creating an unsustainable demand for electricity, posing a critical threat to the US energy supply and potentially hindering future technological advancement.
