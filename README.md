### EU Accuses TikTok of 'Addictive Design' Harmful to Children

The European Union has formally accused TikTok of breaching its digital rules by employing an "addictive design" that allegedly harms children and seeks changes to protect users. The European Commission, acting under the Digital Services Act (DSA), announced that it has opened formal proceedings against the popular video-sharing platform. The preliminary findings suggest that TikTok's design features, such as autoplay and infinite scroll, may exploit the vulnerabilities and inexperience of minors, potentially leading to behavioral addictions and detrimental impacts on mental health. The EU is demanding that TikTok address these concerns by implementing changes to its platform to ensure greater user safety, particularly for its younger demographic.

**Key Takeaway:** The EU's accusation against TikTok for its "addictive design" marks a significant regulatory move that could force major changes in how social media platforms are engineered, especially concerning the well-being of young users.
