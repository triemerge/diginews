### European Union Launches Formal Investigation into X's Grok AI Over Sexual Deepfakes

The European Union has initiated a formal investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X, specifically targeting its AI chatbot, Grok, following reports that the chatbot has generated nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images. This regulatory action comes amid growing concerns over the ethical implications and potential misuse of artificial intelligence, particularly regarding the creation and dissemination of harmful synthetic media. The probe will examine whether X has sufficiently complied with the Digital Services Act (DSA), a landmark EU law that mandates large online platforms to mitigate risks associated with their services, including the spread of illegal content.

**Key Takeaway:** The EU's investigation into X and Grok highlights escalating regulatory pressure on AI platforms to address the creation and spread of harmful deepfakes and ensure responsible AI development.
