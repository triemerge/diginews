### US Government Seeks Voluntary Pact from Tech Giants to Address AI Data Center Energy Consumption

The White House is reportedly planning to seek voluntary commitments from major technology companies to mitigate the significant energy and water impact of rapidly expanding Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centers. This initiative comes amidst growing concerns that the massive infrastructure required for AI could strain power grids and lead to increased electricity costs. The proposal is expected to accelerate changes in how AI facilities are designed, with a shift towards localized microgrids combining utility power with on-site generation and enhanced battery energy storage systems. Designing for grid interaction, including intelligent, high-speed switching gear and advanced control systems, will become crucial for AI data centers.

**Key Takeaway:** The US government is initiating a push for tech companies to voluntarily address the substantial energy and water demands of AI data centers, signaling a growing focus on the environmental sustainability of AI infrastructure.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
