### EU Imposes Six-Month Deadline on Google to Open Android AI Search to Rivals

The European Union has given Google a six-month ultimatum to dismantle technical barriers preventing rival AI search assistants from operating effectively on its Android platform. This mandate is part of the EU's ongoing efforts to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies and promote competition in the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. Google is also required to provide key data to other search engine providers. This move comes amidst a broader regulatory push by the EU to ensure fair play and prevent monopolies in digital markets, particularly concerning AI-driven services.

**Key Takeaway:** The European Union is forcing Google to open up its Android ecosystem to competing AI search assistants, signaling a significant regulatory intervention in the AI market and a continued crackdown on Big Tech's market control.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
