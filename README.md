### FCC Green-Lights Amazon's Second-Gen Kuiper Satellite System
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has granted approval for Amazon's second-generation Project Kuiper satellite system. This development is crucial for Amazon's ambitious plan to deploy a constellation of satellites aimed at providing broadband internet services globally, similar to SpaceX's Starlink. The approval comes as Amazon also seeks an extension for its first-generation Leo system, which faces a July deadline. This regulatory clearance allows Amazon to proceed with the next phase of its satellite internet infrastructure, intensifying the competition in the low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband sector.

**Key Takeaway:** The FCC's approval of Amazon's second-gen Kuiper satellites marks a significant regulatory milestone for the company's global satellite internet aspirations, heating up the race for space-based broadband.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
