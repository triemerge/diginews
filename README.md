### EU Accuses TikTok of 'Addictive Design' Harmful to Children
The European Union has formally accused TikTok of breaching its digital rules, citing concerns over the platform's "addictive design" that allegedly harms children. The EU is seeking changes to TikTok's practices, specifically pointing to features like autoplay and infinite scroll as contributing factors to potential harm. This move highlights a growing global push for stricter regulation of social media platforms, particularly concerning their impact on younger users and their mental well-being. Authorities are demanding modifications to the app's design to protect users more effectively.

**Key Takeaway:** The EU's accusation against TikTok for its "addictive design" signals a significant regulatory effort to protect children online and could force major changes in how social media platforms are designed and operate globally.
