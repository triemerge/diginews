### Amazon Discovered Child Sexual Abuse Material in AI Training Data

Amazon has reportedly identified a "high volume" of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) within its AI training data, though the company has not disclosed the origin of this deeply disturbing content. This revelation comes as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) reported over one million instances of AI-related child sexual abuse material in 2025, with the vast majority of these reports linked to Amazon. The discovery highlights a severe ethical and safety crisis facing the development and deployment of artificial intelligence, raising serious questions about data sourcing, vetting processes, and the responsible creation of AI models.

**Key Takeaway:** Amazon's discovery of a significant amount of child sexual abuse material in its AI training data reveals a critical and alarming ethical failure in AI development and underscores urgent challenges in data security and child protection within the technology sector.
