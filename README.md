### Global Markets Experience $9 Trillion Volatility Amid Tech Plunge and AI Bubble Fears

Global financial markets experienced unprecedented volatility on January 30, 2026, with an estimated $9 trillion in market capitalization shifting within a 6.5-hour window. This turbulent session saw significant swings in both commodity prices and major US technology stocks. Gold prices initially plummeted by approximately 8%, erasing nearly $3 trillion, before recovering around $2 trillion by the day's close. Silver followed a similar pattern. Concurrently, major US technology stocks came under considerable pressure, with Oracle experiencing a 5.4% drop and chipmaker Nvidia declining 2.7% at the open, fueled by growing fears of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble bursting. The broader S&P 500 index erased $780 billion in intraday trading before recovering $530 billion, and the Nasdaq saw a $760 billion wipeout before regaining $580 billion. This market turmoil suggests underlying fragility and investor apprehension regarding the sustainability of high equity valuations, particularly in the technology sector, amidst concerns that organizations are seeing little return despite significant AI investment.

**Key Takeaway:** Fears of an AI bubble bursting triggered massive volatility across global financial markets, causing significant drops and subsequent recoveries in tech stocks and commodities.
