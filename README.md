### Meta Warns EU Against Targeting US Tech Firms Amid Greenland Tariff Threat

A senior executive at Meta has issued a warning to the European Union, stating that it would be "self-defeating" for Europe to retaliate against potential U.S. tariffs by targeting the American technology industry. Joel Kaplan, Meta's Chief Global Affairs Officer, made these remarks on Wednesday, January 21, 2026, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. His comments come as discussions continue regarding President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs on countries opposing a U.S. takeover of Greenland.

Kaplan emphasized that such a move by Europe would not be in its best interest, highlighting the reliance of millions of European small businesses on U.S. tech services for reaching customers, growing their operations, and creating jobs. He suggested that targeting U.S. tech firms, which dominate markets in smartphones, IT operating systems, social media, and cloud services in Europe, could lead to a "further retaliatory spiral" that would negatively impact everyone involved.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also urged European officials to engage in discussions with President Trump in Davos, rather than reacting with "reflexive anger," to understand his arguments regarding the acquisition of Greenland. European officials are reportedly considering various responses, including the activation of the EU's "anti-coercion" mechanism, which could involve tariffs on U.S. goods or restrictions on U.S. firms from participating in European tenders.

**Key Takeaway:** Meta warns that European retaliation against potential U.S. tariffs on countries opposing a Greenland takeover by targeting American tech firms would be detrimental to Europe's own economic interests.
