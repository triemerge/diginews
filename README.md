### Investors React to Big Tech AI Spending with Scrutiny on Growth

Investors are closely scrutinizing the artificial intelligence (AI) spending of major technology companies, indicating a significant shift in market expectations since the launch of ChatGPT over three years ago. While companies that demonstrate robust revenue growth alongside heavy AI investments, such as Meta Platforms, are largely forgiven for their record spending, those showing slower growth or capacity constraints, like Microsoft's Azure cloud business, face investor apprehension.

Meta Platforms saw its revenue surge by 24% in the December quarter, partly due to AI-enhanced online ad targeting. The company also issued a first-quarter revenue forecast that surpassed estimates, demonstrating that its expanding sales can support an anticipated 87% increase in data-center spending this year, potentially reaching $135 billion. In contrast, Microsoft reported Azure cloud-computing growth that only slightly exceeded expectations and lagged its record quarterly spending. Microsoft's finance chief, Amy Hood, attributed some of this slower growth to the allocation of AI chips for internal development rather than entirely to Azure, which limited its growth metric. This week's earnings reports from major tech firms like Meta and Microsoft are providing a clearer picture of the current state of AI and what markets are prioritizing: not just ambition, but tangible revenue generation and strategic reshaping from AI investments.

**Key Takeaway:** Investors are now demanding clear evidence of revenue growth and strategic impact from Big Tech's massive AI investments, rewarding companies that deliver and penalizing those with slower returns despite high spending.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
