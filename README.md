### Global Chip Stocks Surge as Nvidia CEO Fuels AI Enthusiasm at Davos

Global semiconductor stocks have experienced a significant surge, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos reinforcing investor confidence in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. On Thursday, memory chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co. saw its shares jump by as much as 5% to an unprecedented high, pushing South Korea's benchmark Kospi index above 5,000 for the first time. This follows a more than 3% increase in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index on Wednesday, largely driven by Nvidia.

Huang's comments at the forum further fueled this rally, as he highlighted that the global expansion of AI infrastructure will necessitate trillions of dollars in investment. Analysts note that the "AI Revolution" is a dominant theme at Davos, with the US tech sector leading the charge. This AI boom continues robustly into 2026, despite concerns over high valuations and international tensions. Further insights into crucial industry capital expenditure plans are anticipated with upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies like Intel Corp, Apple Inc, and Meta Platforms Inc.

**Key Takeaway:** Investor enthusiasm for AI, propelled by Nvidia's CEO at Davos, is driving a substantial rally in global semiconductor stocks, signaling massive future investments in AI infrastructure.
