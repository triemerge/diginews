### SpaceX Acquires Elon Musk's AI Company, xAI
Elon Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, has officially acquired his artificial intelligence venture, xAI. The announcement, made approximately three hours ago, consolidates Musk's diverse portfolio of companies under the SpaceX umbrella. This move integrates xAI, which was founded by Musk, directly into the operations of the aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company. While the specific implications for xAI's projects and future direction are still emerging, the acquisition signals a deeper convergence of AI development within Musk's established space exploration and satellite internet enterprises.

**Key Takeaway:** Elon Musk's consolidation of xAI under SpaceX marks a significant strategic integration of his artificial intelligence initiatives with his space technology endeavors.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
