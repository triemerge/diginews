### Tech Stocks Decline as Investors Reassess AI's Revenue Impact

Technology stocks experienced a significant downturn, wiping approximately $300 billion in market value in a single session, as traders began to reassess the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce revenues across the broader tech ecosystem. This shift in investor sentiment particularly affected major Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies, with heavyweights such as Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce, and ServiceNow seeing their shares sink as investors factored in increased AI-enabled competition. The S&P 500 futures remained flat following a 0.84% decline in the previous session. This market reaction reflects a growing concern that while AI offers transformative opportunities, it also poses a significant disruptive threat to the revenue models of established technology firms. In a related development, China's tech sector, as measured by the Hang Seng Tech Index, officially entered bear market territory with a more than 20% plunge from its October peak, fueled by anxieties over potential new taxes on internet services and global fears regarding AI's impact on software categories.

**Key Takeaway:** A widespread re-evaluation of AI's disruptive potential is causing a significant downturn in tech stocks, highlighting investor concerns about its impact on established revenue streams across the industry.
