### Big Tech's $600 Billion AI Spending Spree Fuels Investor Unease

Major technology companies are planning to invest an unprecedented $600 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in 2026, a massive spending spree that is creating significant apprehension among investors. This substantial capital expenditure is raising concerns about its potential impact on corporate profitability and is being viewed as an "existential threat" to traditional software firms.

Companies like Amazon and Alphabet have disclosed plans for capital outlays far exceeding previous expectations for AI infrastructure. Amazon's capital expenditure could double from the previous year, while Alphabet indicated its spending might also double in 2026. These announcements have led to a mixed market reaction, with Amazon's shares falling sharply in pre-market trading, and Alphabet also experiencing losses. Meanwhile, data analytics firms, in particular, are facing considerable selling pressure due to fears that powerful new AI models could disrupt their business models. For instance, London-listed RELX's shares saw a significant drop, contributing to its worst week since 2020, and the S&P 500 software and services index has declined by nearly 10% this week, losing an estimated $1 trillion in market value since late January. Despite some analysts suggesting the selloff might be overdone given the profitability of these tech giants, investors remain cautious, interpreting headlines that once spurred optimism now with greater scrutiny over return on investment and potential market leadership narrowness.

**Key Takeaway:** Big tech's enormous $600 billion investment into AI infrastructure in 2026 is causing investor concern over profitability and the disruptive potential of AI across the software sector.
