### Indian IT Sector Faces Significant Decline Amidst AI Disruption Concerns

Indian IT services stocks, including major players like HCL Technologies, Infosys, Wipro, LTIMindtree, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), have experienced a substantial downturn since the beginning of 2026, with the NIFTY IT index sliding over 10% year-to-date and over the past 30 days. This sell-off is primarily attributed to renewed investor concerns regarding the potential disruption that artificial intelligence (AI) startups and advancements could pose to established IT companies.

On February 12, Indian equity markets closed lower, with heavy selling in IT stocks outweighing gains in other sectors. Infosys saw its share price drop over 6%, reaching its lowest level since April 2025, partly due to weakness in its ADRs and concerns that AI-led changes could impact its traditional software maintenance business. Similarly, Tech Mahindra fell over 6%, and Wipro's share price declined by 4.70%, hitting a fresh 52-week low.

The apprehension extends globally, with software stocks on Wall Street also coming under pressure due to fears of AI-driven disruption. Salesforce, ServiceNow, and the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) all saw declines, with Cisco Systems also reporting weak guidance. This trend highlights a growing investor sentiment that AI startups might bypass or significantly alter the business models of traditional IT services providers, despite industry bodies like Nasscom asserting that AI will redefine and augment, rather than disrupt, India's technology services sector.

**Key Takeaway:** Investor worries about AI startups disrupting established IT companies are causing a significant decline in traditional IT services stock valuations globally, particularly impacting the Indian IT sector.
