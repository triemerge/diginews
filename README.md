### EU Broadens Scope to Phase Out 'High-Risk' Tech Suppliers Across Critical Sectors

The European Union has unveiled a significant draft proposal aiming to phase out components and equipment from "high-risk suppliers" across 18 critical sectors, extending far beyond the existing focus on mobile networks. This move, which implicitly targets Chinese telecommunications giants like Huawei, will impact areas such as medical devices and cloud services, signaling a deepened commitment to cybersecurity and economic independence. The proposal, released on Tuesday, has already drawn strong criticism from companies likely to be affected, with Huawei being a prime example.

The initiative comes amidst heightened concerns over cyber threats, espionage, and geopolitical leverage, pushing the EU to implement stricter oversight of its digital infrastructure supply chains. Under the draft rules, mobile network operators would have a 36-month grace period from the formal identification of a high-risk supplier to replace key components, while timelines for fixed networks are yet to be announced. By expanding restrictions to such a wide array of critical sectors, Brussels emphasizes that cybersecurity is now integral to both economic and physical security.

**Key Takeaway:** The EU is significantly expanding its regulatory efforts to remove "high-risk" tech suppliers from 18 critical sectors, a move with major geopolitical and economic implications for global technology companies.
