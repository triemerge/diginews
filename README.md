### South Korean Crypto Exchange Bithumb Faces Probe After $40 Billion Bitcoin Giveaway Blunder

South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb is under regulatory scrutiny following an accidental giveaway of over $40 billion in Bitcoin in a botched prize event. The Wall Street Journal reported the massive error, which has prompted local regulators to launch an investigation into the exchange. In response, Bithumb has committed to covering losses for any users who sold their Bitcoin due to the incident, temporarily waived trading fees across all assets for the week, and pledged to establish a permanent Customer Protection Fund to safeguard its users. The CEO of Bithumb attributed the colossal mistake to a "deficiency in internal system control."

**Key Takeaway:** A massive $40 billion accidental Bitcoin giveaway by Bithumb highlights significant internal control failures in cryptocurrency exchanges and triggers immediate regulatory action.
