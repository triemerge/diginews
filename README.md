### OpenAI Begins Testing Advertisements in ChatGPT for Free and Go Users

OpenAI has commenced testing advertisements within its AI chatbot, ChatGPT, targeting free and "Go" tier users in the United States. This move, which comes after recent public criticism and competition from rivals like Anthropic, signals a significant shift in the company's monetization strategy for its popular artificial intelligence tool. OpenAI stated that the introduction of ads aims to fund the continued free access to ChatGPT for a broader user base while reducing usage limitations. The company assured users that these advertisements will be clearly labeled as "sponsored" and will be visually separated from ChatGPT's responses, ensuring they do not influence the AI's generated answers. The initial rollout is limited to a subset of logged-in adult users on the Free and Go plans.

**Key Takeaway:** OpenAI is introducing advertisements in ChatGPT for free and Go users in the U.S. to support free access and manage operational costs, explicitly stating that ads will not influence AI responses.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
