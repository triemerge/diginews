### Anthropic's New AI Tool Rocks Cybersecurity Stock Market

Anthropic, a leading artificial intelligence company, has introduced Claude Code Security, an innovative AI-powered tool designed to scan codebases for vulnerabilities and suggest patches. The announcement on Friday, February 21, 2026, sent immediate shockwaves through the cybersecurity sector, resulting in a significant market downturn for several prominent cybersecurity firms.

The unveiling of Claude Code Security, integrated into Anthropic's Claude Code platform, prompted a broad-based sell-off across the cybersecurity industry. Major players like CrowdStrike saw their stock drop by approximately 8%, while Cloudflare slid 8%, Okta fell over 9%, SailPoint shed roughly 9%, and Zscaler declined about 5.5%. Even Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet experienced declines of 2-4% during the trading session. The Global X Cybersecurity ETF closed at its lowest point since November 2023, down nearly 5%, with the combined sell-off wiping billions in market value from the sector in a single day. This incident marks the latest in a series of AI-triggered disruptions that have impacted software stocks throughout the year, highlighting the increasing influence of AI advancements on traditional tech industries.

**Key Takeaway:** Anthropic's new AI-powered code security tool has immediately disrupted the cybersecurity market, causing a multi-billion dollar stock devaluation and signaling AI's growing capacity to reshape established tech sectors.
