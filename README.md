### International AI Safety Report 2026 Released as a Comprehensive Assessment
A new International AI Safety Report 2026 has been published, presenting the most comprehensive evidence-based assessment to date of artificial intelligence capabilities, emerging risks, and necessary safety measures. Over 100 independent experts, including Nobel laureates and Turing Award winners, contributed to the report, with a Gates Cambridge Scholar also participating in the writing group for the "Current Capabilities" section. Professor Yoshua Bengio, who chaired the project, highlighted the "evidence dilemma" facing policymakers, where AI capabilities evolve rapidly but scientific evidence for policy decisions emerges slowly. The report aims to provide reliable evidence to help policymakers, researchers, and the public make informed choices regarding the development and deployment of this critical technology.

**Key Takeaway:** A major international report has been released to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based guide for understanding and managing the rapidly evolving risks and capabilities of artificial intelligence.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
