### US Plans to Exempt Big Tech from Upcoming Chip Tariffs for AI Data Centers

The U.S. administration is reportedly planning to provide exemptions for major technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft from impending tariffs on chips. This move is aimed at supporting these companies as they continue to build crucial AI data centers. The Financial Times reported this development on Monday, citing sources familiar with the matter. These carve-outs would be administered by the Commerce Department and are expected to be linked to investment commitments from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which is currently investing $165 billion in constructing factories in Arizona, U.S. This strategic decision highlights the government's intent to foster the growth of AI infrastructure within the country, even amidst broader tariff policies.

**Key Takeaway:** The U.S. government is considering strategic tariff exemptions for major tech companies to accelerate the development of domestic AI data center infrastructure.
