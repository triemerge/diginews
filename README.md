### TikTok Finalizes Deal for U.S. Entity, Averting Potential Ban

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has reportedly finalized a deal to establish a new American entity, selling a majority stake to a group of non-Chinese investors. This development is crucial as it aims to circumvent the long-standing threat of a ban on the popular social media platform in the United States. The move is expected to restructure TikTok's U.S. operations, addressing national security concerns that have been raised by American lawmakers for several years.

**Key Takeaway:** TikTok's restructuring to form a U.S.-majority-owned entity significantly reduces the immediate threat of a ban, ensuring its continued operation in the American market under new ownership.
