### SpaceX Seeks Approval for a Million-Satellite Orbital Data Center

SpaceX has filed a request with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch a constellation of up to one million satellites designed to function as an orbital data center. This ambitious proposal aims to significantly expand the company's satellite network beyond its current Starlink internet service, with the new satellites specifically geared towards powering artificial intelligence needs.

While details such as the size, cost, or exact launch schedule of these satellites were not immediately available in the filing, the move underscores SpaceX's intention to play a pivotal role in the burgeoning AI infrastructure landscape. This development suggests a future where critical data processing and AI operations could increasingly be distributed in orbit, potentially offering new efficiencies and capabilities.

**Key Takeaway:** SpaceX is planning a massive expansion into orbital data centers with a million satellites, aiming to support global AI infrastructure.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
