### Tesla Halts Model S and X Production to Prioritize Optimus Robots

Tesla has announced a major strategic shift, confirming the cessation of production for its Model S and Model X electric vehicles. CEO Elon Musk stated during an earnings call that the decision was made to repurpose the company's Fremont, California factory to accelerate the manufacturing of Optimus humanoid robots. This move signifies a deeper commitment to artificial intelligence and robotics, fundamentally altering Tesla's identity beyond that of solely an electric vehicle manufacturer. The Model S and Model X, while iconic, represented a smaller fraction of Tesla's overall vehicle deliveries compared to the Model 3 and Model Y, making this reallocation of resources a significant strategic re-prioritization towards AI and robotics initiatives.

**Key Takeaway:** Tesla is making a significant strategic pivot by ending the production of its Model S and Model X vehicles to focus manufacturing resources on the development and production of Optimus humanoid robots, underscoring its long-term vision in AI and robotics.
