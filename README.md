### Concurrent Technologies Unveils Powerful 32-Core Kratos CPU for Defense and High-Performance Applications

Concurrent Technologies Plc, a leading designer and manufacturer of computer products for high-performance markets, has announced the launch of its new Kratos (32 Core) central processing unit (CPU). This advanced CPU boasts 32 cores, offering up to 60% more processing power than its predecessor, the 20-core Kratos released in March 2025. The Kratos (32 Core) is specifically optimized for intense data processing within mission-critical C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance) applications, primarily targeting the defense industry. Its high performance density is designed to potentially replace much larger rack-mount server systems, and it expands Concurrent Technologies' market reach by providing breakthrough processing capabilities for defense applications. Dr. Miles Adcock, CEO, highlighted that this launch positions Concurrent Technologies at the forefront of defense technology, emphasizing their "first-to-market reputation" as neither Kratos nor Kratos (32 Core) have direct competitors using these processors in the widely adopted VPX defense standard architecture.

**Key Takeaway:** Concurrent Technologies has introduced a highly powerful 32-core CPU, the Kratos (32 Core), significantly boosting processing capabilities for critical defense and high-performance computing sectors.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
