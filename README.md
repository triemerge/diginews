### Tech Giants Face Landmark Trial Over Youth Addiction Claims

Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok, and Google's YouTube are set to face a landmark trial in Los Angeles, beginning this week, over allegations that their platforms are deliberately designed to addict and harm children. Jury selection for the trial commenced this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. This marks the first instance where these major tech companies will argue such a case before a jury, and the trial's outcome could significantly impact their business practices and how they manage children's access and usage of their platforms. The jury selection process is anticipated to take several days, with approximately 75 potential jurors being questioned daily through at least Thursday.

**Key Takeaway:** A crucial trial against Meta, TikTok, and YouTube over alleged youth addiction to their platforms could profoundly reshape the future of social media and its impact on young users.
