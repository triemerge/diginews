### Amazon Leo Hints at Opening Satellite Internet Tech to Third-Party Antennas

Amazon's Project Kuiper, its ambitious satellite internet initiative, has indicated a potential strategy to open its technology to third-party antenna manufacturers. A recent regulatory filing revealed details about the "Amazon Leo modem module (ALMM)," suggesting it can be integrated into external antenna hardware designed for enterprise and government users. This move could signify Amazon's intent to broaden the reach and adoption of its satellite internet services beyond its proprietary equipment, fostering partnerships and potentially accelerating the deployment of satellite-based connectivity in various sectors.

**Key Takeaway:** Amazon's exploration of opening its Leo satellite internet modem technology to third-party antennas suggests a strategic move to expand its market presence and foster wider adoption of its Project Kuiper services.
