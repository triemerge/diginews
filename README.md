### Escalating AI Demand Triggers Critical Hardware Supply Crisis

The booming demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers is causing a severe hardware supply crisis, with significant implications for the entire tech industry, including consumer electronics manufacturers. Western Digital's hard drive capacity for 2026 is reportedly almost entirely allocated to AI data centers, signaling a major shift in storage demand. This crunch extends beyond just hard drives, as Phison's CEO has issued warnings about an impending "AI memory crisis" that could potentially lead to the bankruptcy or exit of various product lines for consumer electronics companies by the end of 2026. The unprecedented hunger for advanced storage and memory to power AI models and infrastructure is straining the supply chain, creating a critical bottleneck for future technological development and production across multiple sectors.

**Key Takeaway:** The insatiable demand for hardware by AI data centers is creating a profound supply crisis in storage and memory, threatening to disrupt consumer electronics production and fundamentally reshape the tech industry's foundational infrastructure.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
