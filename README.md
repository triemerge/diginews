### UK Government Invests £36 Million to Boost AI Supercomputing in Cambridge

The UK government has announced a significant investment of £36 million to enhance the artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputing capacity at the University of Cambridge, aiming to boost British AI innovation. This funding will increase the power of the DAWN supercomputer, already one of the UK's most powerful AI machines, sixfold by spring 2026. The expanded computing resources will be made available free of charge to UK researchers and tech startups, providing them with critical infrastructure to develop advanced AI tools and drive breakthroughs. The DAWN supercomputer has already supported over 350 projects, including the development of AI tools for personalized cancer vaccines and environmental modeling. This initiative is expected to accelerate advancements in areas such as early disease detection, smarter public services, and improved climate weather data.

**Key Takeaway:** The UK government's substantial investment in AI supercomputing at Cambridge is set to significantly accelerate British AI research and development by providing crucial infrastructure to researchers and startups.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
