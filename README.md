### EU Accuses TikTok of 'Addictive Design' Harming Children

The European Union has formally accused TikTok of violating its digital rules, citing concerns over the platform's "addictive design" and its detrimental impact on children. The accusations specifically highlight features like autoplay and infinite scroll as contributing to harmful user engagement practices. The EU is demanding that TikTok implement changes to better protect its younger users.

**Key Takeaway:** The EU's action against TikTok signals a growing global regulatory push to address the potentially harmful design elements of social media platforms, particularly concerning their effects on minors.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
