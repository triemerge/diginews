### Taiwan and US Forge Strategic High-Tech and AI Supply Chain Partnership

Taiwan and the United States have formalized a new tariffs deal aimed at establishing a "democratic" high-tech supply chain and a strategic artificial intelligence (AI) partnership. The agreement, announced yesterday by Taipei's top negotiator, seeks to bolster US production of semiconductors, particularly those crucial for AI development, with substantial investments from Taiwanese companies. Under the terms of the deal, chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) that expand their manufacturing capacity in the US will benefit from lower tariffs on imported semiconductors and related equipment, with some items even entering duty-free.

This long-negotiated agreement also includes a reduction in broad tariffs on most other Taiwanese exports to the US, from 20 percent to 15 percent. Taiwanese enterprises are poised to invest a considerable $250 billion to boost semiconductor and AI production in the US, complemented by an additional $250 billion in credit guaranteed by Taiwan to facilitate further investment. Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun emphasized that this deal is not intended to diminish Taiwan's vital chip industry but rather to empower its high-tech sectors to expand their international footprint, particularly in the United States. Chipmakers increasing their US presence will be permitted to import up to 2.5 times their new capacity of semiconductors and wafers without extra tariffs during an approved construction period, and will receive preferential treatment for quantities exceeding this quota.

**Key Takeaway:** The new US-Taiwan agreement is a landmark deal poised to significantly reshape global high-tech supply chains and accelerate AI development through massive investments and strategic partnerships.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
