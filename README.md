### Meta Pauses Teen Access to AI Characters Amid Safety Concerns

Meta has temporarily suspended teen users' ability to interact with AI characters on its platforms. The move comes as a response to growing concerns over the potential risks of AI interactions for younger audiences, particularly regarding safety and well-being. This decision impacts a significant user base, reflecting a proactive stance by the tech giant to address ethical considerations in the deployment of artificial intelligence, especially when engaging with minors. The pause allows Meta to further evaluate and implement safeguards to ensure that AI character interactions are appropriate and safe for teenagers.

**Key Takeaway:** Meta is halting teen access to AI characters on its platforms to enhance safety protocols and address concerns about the impact of AI on young users.

##  How It Works

This project leverages the power of **GitHub Actions** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to deliver high-quality, grounded tech news.

1.  **Timed Trigger**: A workflow runs automatically every 6 hours.
2.  **C++ Engine**: The system spins up and compiles a custom C++ application (`src/main.cpp`).
3.  **AI Analysis**: It sends a request to the Gemini API with **Google Search Grounding** enabled.
4.  **Self-Correction**: The output is validated and committed back to this `README.md`.
