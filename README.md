### Brazil Proposes High-Tech International Airport to Boost Connectivity

A consortium of private investors, with the backing of the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF), revealed plans on January 24 for a new high-tech international airport in Brazil's historically underserved Northeast region. The project, announced during the 'Brasil 360° Tourism & Investment Forum' in São Paulo, aims to revolutionize air connectivity and requires congressional approval for Bill 4.392/2025, which would permit foreign airlines to operate cabotage flights, essential for establishing a true regional hub. Pre-feasibility studies for the proposed multi-runway complex envision a facility equipped with automated baggage-handling robots, biometric e-gates, and solar-powered infrastructure, designed to accommodate 15 million passengers annually by 2035. States like Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte are competing to host the airport, offering complementary tourism assets and tax incentives. The Ministry of Portos e Aeroportos estimates that this functional hub could reduce travel times for executives heading to renewable energy projects or tech parks by up to four hours.

**Key Takeaway:** A major high-tech airport project in Brazil's Northeast promises to significantly enhance regional connectivity and integrate advanced technology into its operations by 2035.
