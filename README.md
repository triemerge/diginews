### Fear Over New AI Tools Triggers Tech Selloff Across Global Markets

Concerns surrounding the perceived threat of new artificial intelligence (AI) tools to established software companies have led to a significant selloff in technology shares across major U.S. and Asian stock indexes. On Tuesday, all three primary U.S. stock indexes experienced declines as investors reacted to these new worries. Companies heavily involved in software, including Legalzoom.com, Expedia, Ares, and Apollo, saw their share prices fall sharply. This market reaction signals a growing apprehension among investors about the potential disruptive impact of advanced AI technologies on the existing software landscape.

**Key Takeaway:** Investor anxiety over the disruptive potential of new AI tools has caused a widespread downturn in technology stock values across global markets.
